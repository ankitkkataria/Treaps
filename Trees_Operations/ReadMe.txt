This code is for checking how many comparisions and rotations each of the data structure among Treap,AvlTree and BstTree will take if it were to run on some test file containing some random delete and insert operations.
Readme.
Please to run this code use Dev-C++ 
1)Click on Trees_Operations Dev-C++ project file.
2) And then run the code by default i've chosen the testfile1 to check the no. of operations on.
3) There are 20 files in the testcasefiles folder each containing a different number of insert and delete      operations.
4) If you want to check the number of operations on a different testfile say testfile19 then goto line number:-1316 and change the testcase file name form testfile1 to testfile19.
After you run this code you'll see the all the number of operations and rotations needed as well as height of each tree on the console itself.
