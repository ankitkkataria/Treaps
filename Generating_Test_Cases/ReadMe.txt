This code is to generate test case files which will contain random insert and delete functions.
 If you can't run this code in Dev-C++ please try using a different IDE i've used CODELITE IDE and it works perfectly fine.
1) Click on main.cpp
2) Run the program
3) Enter how many testfiles you'd like to generate.
4) Then for each file it will ask you how many total operations you'd like to have in that file.
5) Then it will ask you how much of those operations you'd like to be delete operations 
6) Then after the program is done running it will produce some test files in the same directory.
